# todo_list

This is a to-do list app with basic features:
- Adding a task (color, name)
- Changing the task
- Delete a task
- Adding a subtask
- Managing task status

The following libraries were used:
- hive (local database)
- flutter_mobx (state management)
- provider (state management)
- flutter_colorpicker (just for selecting the color of the elements) 

The application is a little unfinished, there are some bugs, but overall it works.
